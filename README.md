Project Overview

Data Analysis and Display
I analyzed data stored in arrays and objects to present information on my website. The 'searchProducts' function filters the 'products' array based on user input and displays the filtered results. This functionality enhances the user experience by providing relevant product information efficiently.

Data Storage and Retrieval
I used arrays and objects to store and retrieve information displayed on the webpage. Specifically, the 'products' array is used to manage product details, which are populated by the 'fetchProducts' function from a JSON file.

API Integration
I retrieved data from a third-party API to display the world population on the "Healthier Smile, Healthier You" page. This real-time data fetch and display demonstrate the dynamic capabilities of the website.
