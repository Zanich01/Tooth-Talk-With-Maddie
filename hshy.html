            <p><br>According to the CDC, nearly half of the population aged 30 years and older, which translates to approximately 972 million
               people, have periodontitis. Furthermore, 85% of the global population, or around 6.6 billion people, suffer from some form of gum 
               disease, making it more prevalent than diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. Despite this high prevalence, only 60% of those 
               affected, or about 4 billion people, are aware of their condition, leaving roughly 2.6 billion people unaware that they have gum 
               disease.</p>
        
            <div class="line">

            <p>The pathogenic bacteria that is responsible for periodontal disease is correlated to several systemic conditions. This bacteria 
                spreads through the bloodstream to the rest of the body, increasing risk of developing disease in these areas as well. 
                Systemic diseases can also put one at more risk of developing periodontal disease, as the immune function may be deficient 
                depending on the systemic condition.</p>

              <h2><br>Brain</h2>

              <p>The bacteria present in periodontal disease is found in the brains of patients with Alzheimerâ€™s disease and dementia. 
                    Periodontitis is also a risk factor that increases the likelihood of a stroke occurring.</p>

            <div class="section">
                
              <h2>Lungs</h2>

              <p>Bacteria from periodontal disease can be inhaled and spread to the lungs, contributing to the development of respiratory 
                   diseases like pneumonia and bronchitis. It can also worsen symptoms for patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 
                   (COPD).</p>

            <div class="section">

              <h2>Heart</h2>
                
              <p>Patients with periodontal disease are two to three times more likely to have a heart attack or stroke. Uncontrolled 
                   hypertension (high blood pressure) is directly correlated to uncontrolled periodontal disease.</p>
            
            </div>
    
            <div class="section">

              <h2>Pancreas</h2>

              <p>Periodontal disease is linked with complications in controlling blood sugar for patients with diabetes. Patients with
                   diabetes also have a reduced immune response, which allows for the periodontal bacteria to run rampant and progress
                   much quicker than in someone without diabetes.</p>
            
            </div>
    
            <div class="section">
      
              <h2>Reproductive Organs</h2>
      
              <p>Patients with periodontal disease are more likely to have issues with infertility, adverse birth outcomes during pregnancy
                 like low-birth weight and premature birth, and the development of erectile dysfunction.</p>

            </div>
    
            <div class="section">

                <h2>Cancer</h2>

                <p>The link between the bacteria present in periodontal disease and the development of many forms of cancer are significant.
                   There is an overall 24% increased risk of developing cancer among patients with severe periodontitis.</p>
    
                <div class="cancer-risk">

                    <h3>The following is a breakdown of each type of cancer and the associated increased risk of developing it in patients
                        with periodontal disease:</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Esophageal Cancer - 43% increased risk</li>
                        <li>Throat Cancer - 43% increased risk</li>
                        <li>Stomach Cancer - 52% increased risk</li>
                        <li>Lung Cancer - 24% increased risk</li>
                        <li>Pancreatic Cancer - 59% increased risk</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><br>There are also ties to oral, thyroid, breast, and bladder cancer and leukemia.</p>
